## Implementation

### Class diagram

The class diagram below shows the implementation of the **Memento** design pattern.

![Memento Implementation Class Diagram](resource:assets/images/memento/memento_implementation.png)

_ICommand_ is an abstract class which is used as an interface for the specific command:

- _execute()_ - an abstract method which executes the command;
- _undo()_ - an abstract method which undoes the command and returns the state to the previous snapshot of it.

_RandomisePropertiesCommand_ is a concrete command which implements the abstract class _ICommand_ and its methods.

_CommandHistory_ is a simple class which stores a list of already executed commands (_commandList_) and provides methods to add a new command to the command history list (_add()_) and undo the last command from that list (_undo()_).

_IMemento_ is an abstract class which is used as an interface for the specific memento class:

- _getState()_ - an abstract method which returns the snapshot of the internal originator's state.

_Memento_ is a class that acts as a snapshot of the originator's internal state which is stored in the _state_ property and returned via the _getState()_ method.

_Shape_ is a simple data class which is used as an internal originator's state. It stores multiple properties defining the shape presented in UI: _color_, _height_ and _width_.

_Originator_ - a simple class which contains its internal state and stores the snapshot of it to the _Memento_ object using the _createMemento()_ method. Also, the originator's state could be restored from the provided _Memento_ object using the _restore()_ method.

_MementoExample_ initializes and contains _CommandHistory_, _Originator_ objects. Also, this component contains a _PlatformButton_ widget which has the command of _RandomisePropertiesCommand_ assigned to it. When the button is pressed, the command is executed and added to the command history list stored in _CommandHistory_ object.

### Shape

A simple class to store information about the shape: its color, height and width. Also, this class contains several constructors:

- _Shape()_ - a basic constructor to create a shape object with provided values;
- _Shape.initial()_ - a named constructor to create a shape object with pre-defined initial values;
- _Shape.copy()_ - a named constructor to create a shape object as a copy of the provided _Shape_ value.

```
class Shape {
  Color color;
  double height;
  double width;

  Shape(this.color, this.height, this.width);

  Shape.initial() {
    color = Colors.black;
    height = 150.0;
    width = 150.0;
  }

  Shape.copy(Shape shape) : this(shape.color, shape.height, shape.width);
}
```

### ICommand

An interface which defines methods to be implemented by the specific command classes. Dart language does not support the interface as a class type, so we define an interface by creating an abstract class and providing a method header (name, return type, parameters) without the default implementation.

```
abstract class ICommand {
  void execute();
  void undo();
}
```

### RandomisePropertiesCommand

A specific implementation of the command which sets all the properties of the _Shape_ object stored in the _Originator_ to random values. Also, the class implements the _undo_ operation.

```
class RandomisePropertiesCommand implements ICommand {
  Originator originator;
  IMemento _backup;

  RandomisePropertiesCommand(this.originator) {
    _backup = originator.createMemento();
  }

  @override
  void execute() {
    var shape = originator.state;
    shape.color = Color.fromRGBO(
        random.integer(255), random.integer(255), random.integer(255), 1.0);
    shape.height = random.integer(150, min: 50).toDouble();
    shape.width = random.integer(150, min: 50).toDouble();
  }

  @override
  void undo() {
    if (_backup != null) {
      originator.restore(_backup);
    }
  }
}
```

### CommandHistory

A simple class which stores a list of already executed commands. Also, this class provides _isEmpty_ getter method to return true if the command history list is empty. A new command could be added to the command history list via the _add()_ method and the last command could be undone using the _undo()_ method (if the command history list is not empty).

```
class CommandHistory {
  final ListQueue<ICommand> _commandList = ListQueue<ICommand>();

  bool get isEmpty => _commandList.isEmpty;

  void add(ICommand command) {
    _commandList.add(command);
  }

  void undo() {
    if (_commandList.isNotEmpty) {
      var command = _commandList.removeLast();
      command.undo();
    }
  }
}
```

### IMemento

An interface which defines the _getState()_ method to be implemented by the specific Memento class.

```
abstract class IMemento {
  Shape getState();
}
```

### Memento

An implementation of the _IMemento_ interface which stores the snapshot of _Originator's_ internal state (_Shape_ object). The state is accessible to the _Originator_ via the _getState()_ method.

```
class Memento extends IMemento {
  Shape _state;

  Memento(Shape shape) {
    _state = Shape.copy(shape);
  }

  Shape getState() {
    return _state;
  }
}
```

### Originator

A class which defines a _createMemento()_ method to save the current internal state to a _Memento_ object.

```
class Originator {
  Shape state;

  Originator() {
    state = Shape.initial();
  }

  IMemento createMemento() {
    return Memento(state);
  }

  void restore(IMemento memento) {
    state = memento.getState();
  }
}
```

### Example

_MementoExample_ contains _CommandHistory_ and _Originator_ objects. Also, this widget contains a _PlatformButton_ component which uses the _RandomisePropertiesCommand_ to randomise property values of the shape. After the command's execution, it is added to the command history list stored in the _CommandHistory_ object. If the command history is not empty, the _Undo_ button is enabled and the last command could be undone.

As you can see in this example, the client code (UI elements, command history, etc.) isnâ€™t coupled to any specific command class because it works with it via the _ICommand_ interface.

In addition to what the Command design pattern provides to this example, the Memento design pattern adds an additional layer on the example's state. It is stored inside the Originator object, the command itself does not mutate the state directly but through the Originator. Also, the backup (state's snapshot) stored inside the Command is a Memento object and not the state (Shape object) itself - in case of the state's restore (undo is triggered on the command), the specific command calls the restore method on the Originator which restores its internal state to the value stored in the snapshot. Hence, it allows restoring multiple property values (a whole complex state object) in a single request, while the state itself is completely separated from the command's code or UI logic.

```
class MementoExample extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MementoExampleState createState() => _MementoExampleState();
}

class _MementoExampleState extends State<MementoExample> {
  final CommandHistory _commandHistory = CommandHistory();
  final Originator _originator = Originator();

  void _randomiseProperties() {
    var command = RandomisePropertiesCommand(_originator);
    _executeCommand(command);
  }

  void _executeCommand(ICommand command) {
    setState(() {
      command.execute();
      _commandHistory.add(command);
    });
  }

  void _undo() {
    setState(() {
      _commandHistory.undo();
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ScrollConfiguration(
      behavior: ScrollBehavior(),
      child: SingleChildScrollView(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: paddingL),
        child: Column(
          children: <Widget>[
            ShapeContainer(
              shape: _originator.state,
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: spaceM),
            PlatformButton(
              child: Text('Randomise properties'),
              materialColor: Colors.black,
              materialTextColor: Colors.white,
              onPressed: _randomiseProperties,
            ),
            Divider(),
            PlatformButton(
              child: Text('Undo'),
              materialColor: Colors.black,
              materialTextColor: Colors.white,
              onPressed: _commandHistory.isEmpty ? null : _undo,
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: spaceM),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
